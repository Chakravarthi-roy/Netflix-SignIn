# Netflix-SignIn
Hello! I see that you've found my Git Repository of Netflix SignIn page. Hope it serves you well.
Well, this is just a frontend part of the signin page. I might update the repository with the backend part which includes the access code to the database. You can use the font I've used for this developnent. You just have to add it to your system fonts. Grab the file and drop it in the fonts of your system. And You can use the logo symbol as well by keeping it in your folder.
